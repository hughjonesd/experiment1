<p>We are doing a research study about young people's behaviour. 
If you decide that you want to be part of this study, you will be asked 
to make some simple choices.</p>

<p>When we are finished with this study we will 
write a report about what we learned. This report will not mention your name. 
Nobody will know about the choices you made except us, the researchers.</p>

<p>You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to be. If you decide 
to stop after we begin, thatâ€™s okay too. Your parents know about the study 
too.</p>

<p>If you do not want to be in the study, just raise your hand.</p>

<p>If you want to be in the study, please sign the paper consent form on your desk.</p>

<p>When the experimenter tells you, click "Next".</p>
